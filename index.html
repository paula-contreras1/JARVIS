          Hi! My name is <b>Paula Daniela Contreras</b>, and I am 17 years old.
          I was born in <b>Bucaramanga, Colombia</b> I moved to the United
          States last year, at the end of November. I am currently living in
          Weston, Florida with my mom, dad, my little sister and my dog. I am
          currently a rising senior and I am considering majoring in
          <b>biomedical/mechanical/civil engineering.</b>
          I love learning languages! My first language is <b>Spanish</b>, but I
          speak English and German fluently and I am currently learning French
          and Japanese, which is super hard! I also really enjoy listening to
          music, playing the piano, reading books, starting TV shows and then
          forgetting to finish them.
        </p>
